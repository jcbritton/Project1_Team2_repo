## Project Description
This project aims to explore the complex relationship between armed conflict and water scarcity by integrating and analyzing datasets from various sources. We will leverage geospatial and environmental data to assess how water scarcity influences the occurrence and intensity of conflicts. This analysis will help to understand whether areas with significant water stress experience higher levels of conflict and how water scarcity impacts socio-political stability.

## Project Tasks
1. Data Collection: Define conflict and water scarcity, then retrieve conflict and water scarcity data from relevant APIs.
2. Data Processing: Clean and format the collected data.
3. Data Integration: Merge datasets to facilitate analysis.
4. Analysis & Visualization: Perform statistical and geospatial analysis to identify correlations and patterns and create visualizations to represent findings and insights.

## Hypothesis
Water is one of the most critical resources on the planet for human survival. When the demand for critical resources, such as water, exceeds the supply the number of conflicts increases.

## Research Questions to Answer
1. Does water scarcity correlate with frequency and intensity of armed conflicts? (Matthew Smith)
2. What are the geographical patterns of conflict relative to water scarcity? (Jason Britton)
3. Are certain types of conflicts more likely to occur in water-scarce regions? (Jason Britton)
5. Are there other factors that affect the frequency of armed conflicts in water scarce areas?
