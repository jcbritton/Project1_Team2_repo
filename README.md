## Project Description/Outline
This project aims to explore the complex relationship between armed conflict and water scarcity by integrating and analyzing datasets from various sources. We will leverage geospatial and environmental data to assess how water scarcity influences the occurrence and intensity of conflicts. This analysis will help to understand whether areas with significant water stress experience higher levels of conflict and how water scarcity impacts socio-political stability.
1. Data Collection: Define conflict and water scarcity, then retrieve conflict and water scarcity data from relevant APIs.
2. Data Processing: Clean and format the collected data.
3. Data Integration: Merge datasets to facilitate analysis.
4. Analysis: Perform statistical and geospatial analysis to identify correlations and patterns.
5. Visualization: Create visualizations to represent findings and insights.


## Research Questions to Answer
1. How does water scarcity correlate with the frequency and intensity of armed conflicts?
   * Analyze conflict data in regions experiencing severe water stress compared to regions with adequate water resources.
2. What are the geographical patterns of conflict relative to water scarcity?
   * Map conflict events and water scarcity metrics to identify regions with overlapping issues.
3. Can changes in water availability predict increases in conflict events?
   * Investigate temporal relationships between water scarcity trends and conflict occurrences.
4. Are certain types of conflicts more likely to occur in water-scarce regions?
   * Assess if specific conflict types (e.g., resource-driven, ethnic clashes) are more prevalent in water-stressed areas.
5. Are there other factors that affect the frequency of armed conflicts in water scarce areas?
   * Research and determine if and how much these factors might affect the water scarcity - conflict correlation
       1. Socio-political factors
            * Per-capita income
            * Degree of political freedom 
        2. Geographical
            * Proximity to equator
            * Elevation
            * Proximity to bodies of fresh water
            * Rainfall
            * Climate
